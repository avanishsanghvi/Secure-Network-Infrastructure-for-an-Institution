# Secure-Network-Infrastructure-for-an-Institution
A secure network infrastructure for an institution (here, SRMIST).  
Tools Used: Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.0.0.0212   
Here's a demo of my proposal for a secure network design for SRM Institute of Science and Technology as part of my internship at Cisco.   
Individuals Servers for:
* IT Services/Dept.
* Accountsâ€™ Dept.
* Administration
* Faculties
* Students

The email and web servers (Main Server, given an IP address of 192.168.0.5) will be configured in the IT.   
Each switch will be given a name to the network they are assigned to.
